Development of the song Wake Me Up by Avicii using signals in MatLab with Karplus Strong Algorithm

Created by Fernando Grahl Zuffo
Computer Engineering Student at UNOESC (Universidade do Oeste de Santa Catarina or West of Saint Catarin University), located in Santa Catarina - Brazil


This Algorithm uses Karplus Strong as bases for the Signals and Sounds and MatLab to Synthezise them, divided in 2 files, one with the Karplus Strong Function and other with the song itself, Based of the instrumental version of the song Wake Me Up by Avicii and Aloe Blacc.

Also, I've used FL Studio to create the basic notes of the progressions, melody et cetera.

I've declared each variable in the song and created mutiple arrays with the notes based of the Fl Studio project, which to be fair facilitated a lot of the development. Some parts/instruments may be missing since I couldn't develop all of them, used a base Piano, Lead and Some Drums.

Hope you enjoy it, feel free to improve it!!
